when you execute my_large_list = [0] * 10**8, it creates a list with 100 million zeros. 
This can be useful for creating large lists with identical elements or initializing 
data structures with a specific pattern. 
This may lead to a MemoryError if the system does not have 
sufficient available memory to accommodate such a large list.
