# List comprehension examples

# example 1

# The code is converting each letter in the string `random_name` to uppercase using list
# comprehension. It creates a new list called `converted_name` where each element is the uppercase
# version of each letter in `random_name`. Then, it joins the elements of `converted_name` into a
# single string using the `join()` method with an empty string as the separator. Finally, it prints
# the resulting uppercase string.
converted_name = [letter.upper() for letter in random_name]
print("".join(converted_name))

# # example 2
# The code is creating a new list called `animal_spotter` using list comprehension. It iterates over
# each element in the `list_of_animals` list and creates a new string for each element in the format
# "oh look! a {animal}!". The `{animal}` placeholder is replaced with the current element from
# `list_of_animals`. The resulting strings are added to the `animal_spotter` list. Finally, the
# contents of the `animal_spotter` list are printed.
list_of_animals = ["ant", "mongoose", "hamster", "hyena"]

# list comprehension way
# The code is using list comprehension to create a new list called `three_worded_words`. It splits the
# string `strange_phrase` into a list of words using the space character as the delimiter. Then, it
# iterates over each word in the list and checks if the length of the word is greater than or equal to
# 5. If the condition is true, the word is added to the `three_worded_words` list. Finally, it prints
# the contents of the `three_worded_words` list.

# The code is assigning the string "Austin Powers" to the variable `rand_word`. Then, it checks if
# `rand_word` is equal to "Austin Powers". If it is, it assigns the string "groovy baby" to the
# variable `is_valid`. If `rand_word` is not equal to "Austin Powers", it assigns the string "not
# groovy baby" to `is_valid`. Finally, it prints the value of `is_valid`, which will be either "groovy
# baby" or "not groovy baby" depending on the value of `rand_word`.
